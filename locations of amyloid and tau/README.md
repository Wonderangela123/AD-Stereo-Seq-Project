1. Find differential genes (marker genes) by comparing gene expressions among clusters.

2. Generate annotation dictionary for cells based on marker genes/cell-type-specific (CTS) genes. (cell level and cluster level)

3. Annotate clusters using annotation dictionary.

4. Extract the clusters annotated as "microglia" from all cells and cluster the annotated "microglia" again

5. Annotate the new clusters again.

6. Use the subtype "microglia" to match the gene expression patterns with known public data (p1 - p4) (clustering -> annotation).
